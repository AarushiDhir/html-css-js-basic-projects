The first project I made, Color Flipper is a basic application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
A random background color is generated on clicking on a button. 
Depending on the RGB or Hex button, a random code is generated to output the color, via an arbitrary generated RGB or Hex code respectively. 
Furthermore, the code is displayed in the heading as the color changes. 
The most challenging parts of the project were using the CSS flexbox and the JS event listener.
